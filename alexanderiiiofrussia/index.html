						<h2>Biography</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Emperor Alexander III was a former Russian emperor, who came into power in 1881 following the death of his father, Emperor Alexander II of Russia. He was born on March 10, 1845 in Saint Petersburg, Russia as the second oldest son of Alexander II, but he became the heir once his older brother unexpectedly died. He got married to his dead brother’s fiancé in 1866. When his father was emperor, Alexander III was not afraid to hide the fact that he did not agree with a lot of the policies his father implemented. Once he rose to power in 1881, Alexander III immediately reversed a lot of his father’s extremely liberal policies. The people of Russia had very split opinions about Alexander III and his policies, but he was still widely accepted. His rule was peaceful for Russia as a whole, as Alexander III did not involve his country in any major wars. This gave him the nickname “The Peacemaker”.</p>

						<h2>Historical Context</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Before Alexander III came to power, there were multiple events in his life that affected what he did as an emperor. For the beginning years of his life, he did not see himself becoming emperor as he had an elder brother. However, when his brother died rather unexpectedly, Alexander III became the new heir. He started to study the principles of law and administration and was taught by K.P. Pobedonostsev, who believed in reactionary views and had a hatred for representative governments. When his father died due to assassins throwing bombs at his carriage in 1881, Alexander II became the new emperor of Russia. However, the assassination of his father has helped him become a stronger ruler, as it made him more weary of his citizens and what they are capable of retaliating against him with. This event combined, with Pobedonostsev’s reactionary teachings, led Alexander III himself to develop reactionary views.</p>

						<h2>Goals</h2>
					</header>
					<p>Alexander III has always dreamed of peace and stability within Russia. To accomplish this peace and stability, he needs to implement more conservative and nationalistic policies. Alexander III needs to ensure his rule is fully autocratic. He will gain this by convincing the people of Russia to trust his autocratic rule. Alexander III believes that too much freedom of speech and press are a threat to Russia and its stability, but he will ensure that the sufficient rights of the people are maintained. By outsmarting political opponents, Russia will gain stability as people should be able to put their full trust into Alexander III’s reign to stabilize Russia. In addition, we will ensure that the Jewish community does not have the required resources to threaten our strong government. Also, people who have a higher wealth are able to contribute more to society, so Alexander III will raise school fees in order to deter the poor from becoming educated. With this autocracy, Russia will stabilize and his strong rule will allow economic systems such as capitalism. </p>

						<h2>Previous accomplishments</h2>
						<p>Alexander III is a very successful man, who accomplished, and is continuing to accomplish many of his goals to make Russia better. To start off, he has already implemented many conservative reforms to combat the poor policies put in place by his father. He has also managed to strengthen the autocracy while barely harming anyone who is a part of the middle class. This is something rare that not many rulers are capable of doing. In addition, his rule so far has been extremely peaceful. Russia has not been involved in any notable wars during this autocratic rule. “The Peacemaker” has been a wonderful ruler thus far, and he has shown that he is capable of being just as successful in the future.</p>

						<h3>Quotes from Alexander III</h3>
						<p>”But in the midst of Our great grief, the voice of God orders Us courageously to undertake, in deference to Divine intention, the task of ruling, with faith in the strength and rightness of autocratic power.” -Emperor Alexander III</p>
						<p>“Now that the wars are coming to an end, I wish you to prosper in peace. May all mortals from now on live like one people in concord and for mutual advancement. Consider the world as your country, with laws common to all and where the best will govern irrespective of tribe. I do not distinguish among men, as the narrow-minded do, both among Greeks and Barbarians. I am not interested in the descendance of the citizens or their racial origins. I classify them using one criterion: their virtue.” -Emperor Alexander III</p>
